<b>Hello everyone!</b> 😁😁😁<br><br>
I'm Paulo Ricardo (<b>@airesricardo</b>), but you can call me Paulo. I'm a future Front-End Developer and I dream of working for a big company.
I just started learning these coding skills a week ago, but I feel like I already made lots of progress. <br><br>
I like to write, to draw, to learn new languages, to play the piano and to workout.
I hope you like my profile! 😎
