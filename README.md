<b>Hello everyone!</b> 😁😁😁<br><br>
I'm Paulo Ricardo (<b>@airesricardo</b>), but you can call me Paulo. I'm a future Front-End Developer, and my dream is to work for a big company.
I started learning tode just a week ago, but I already feel like I made lots of progress. <br><br>
I love writing, drawing, learning new languages, playing the piano, and working out. <br><br>
Hope you like my profile!  😎
